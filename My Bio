â€œBeing in love with law and music as priority number one, she chose Engineering, her second love. Kryzha Lei Aguilar is an Electronics Engineering student in the University of Santo Tomas (UST). A 2nd year college student who is a Presidential Executive Officer of the mother organization of ECE, the UST Network of Electronics Engineering Students (UST NECES). She is also an Executive Associate of the Community Development of the UST Cisco Networking Academy Gateway Engineering (UST CNAG). Kryzha also holds a National Certification which specializes in Computer Hardware Servicing and Network Configuration. A strong believer in the power of music, she continues to play on different grades in guitar, piano, violin, ukulele, and drums, using the skills in serving in the church and teaches children on vacation. Serving the church in leading the choir was also her commitment. Alongside with the field of music, she was also a former Editor-in-Chief and Female Anchor of her former Junior and Senior High School which paved way in training her other aspiring campus journalists. She also showcased interest in debating and was a former Prime Minister which made her voice out social injustices and issues to different target audience, especially the teens. It may seem that engineering, even though it was never her forte and not aligned to her dominant skills, suprisingly engineering makes a good match to her."
